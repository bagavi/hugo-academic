I am a final year graduate student at the [Information Systems Lab](http://isl.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford](https://stanford.edu), advised by [David Tse](https://tselab.stanford.edu/). I am broadly interested in designing practical algorithms which can scale to large systems. I work in areas of machine learning, high-dimensional statistics, and peer-to-peer protocols. **I am actively looking for jobs in the tech industry**.

In 2018 I worked at Applied Protocol with [Mohammad Alizadeh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/), [Pramod Viswanath](http://pramodv.ece.illinois.edu/) among others. In 2017 summer, I worked at [Human longevity](https://www.humanlongevity.com/) with [Alena Harley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alena-harley-7700832/) and [David Hackerman](http://heckerman.com/david/) where we designed a machine learning pipeline to check if a cancer patient should be administered the *KeyTruda* drug. Prior to Stanford, I spent one year as a Quantitative Analyst at Goldman Sachs where we built data driven investment strategies based on live financial data. Before that, I graduated with a B.Tech with honors in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).
