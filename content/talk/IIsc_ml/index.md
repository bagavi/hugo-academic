abstract: The celebrated Monte Carlo method estimates a quantity that is expensive to compute by random sampling. We propose adaptive Monte Carlo optimization - a general framework for discrete optimization of an expensive-to-compute function by adaptive random sampling. Applications of this framework have already appeared in machine learning but are tied to their specific contexts and developed in isolation. We take a unified view and show that the framework has broad applicability by applying it on several common machine learning problems - k nearest neighbors, hierarchical clustering and maximum mutual information feature selection. On real data we show that this framework allows us to develop algorithms that confer a gain of a magnitude or two over exact computation. We also characterize the performance gain theoretically under regularity assumptions on the data that we verify in real world data.
