title: "Prism: 7 to 70000 transactions per second"
event: Allerton Conference

location: Allerton Conference
address:
  city: Allerton
  country: United States


summary: Explained and demonstrated a full-stack implementation of Prism in Rust which acheives '70,000' transactions per second with '40' second latency.

abstract: Bitcoin is the first fully decentralized permissionless blockchain protocol and achieves a high level of security - the ledger it maintains has guaranteed liveness and consistency properties as long as the adversary has less compute power than the honest nodes. However, its throughput is only seven transactions per second and the confirmation latency can be up to hours. Prism is a new blockchain protocol which is designed to achieve a natural scaling of Bitcoin's performance while maintaining its full security guarantees. We present an implementation of Prism which achieves a throughput of seventy thousand transactions per second and confirmation latencies of tens of seconds
