summary: Fast algorithm to solve travelling salesman problem for practical instances.

abstract: We introduce the problem of hidden Hamiltonian cycle recovery, where there is an unknown Hamiltonian cycle in an n-vertex complete graph that needs to be inferred from noisy edge measurements. The measurements are independent and distributed according to $P$ for edges in the cycle and $Q$ otherwise. This formulation is motivated by a problem in genome assembly, where the goal is to order a set of contigs (genome subsequences) according to their positions on the genome using long-range linking measurements between the contigs. Computing the maximum likelihood estimate in this model reduces to a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Despite the NP-hardness of TSP, we show that a simple linear programming (LP) relaxation, namely the fractional 2-factor (F2F) LP, recovers the hidden Hamiltonian cycle with high probability.
