abstract: Computing the medoid of a large number of points in high-dimensional space is an increasingly common operation in many data science problems. We present an algorithm Med-dit which uses O(n log n) distance evaluations to compute the medoid with high probability. Med-dit is based on a connection with the multi-armed bandit problem. We evaluate the performance of Med-dit empirically on the Netflix-prize and the single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, containing hundreds of thousands of points living in tens of thousands of dimensions, and observe a "5-10"x improvement in performance over the current state of the art.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Compute the medoid (high dimensional median) for n points in O(n log n) time.
