abstract: Bitcoin is the first fully decentralized permissionless blockchain protocol and achieves a high level of security - the ledger it maintains has guaranteed liveness and consistency properties as long as the adversary has less compute power than the honest nodes. However, its throughput is only seven transactions per second and the confirmation latency can be up to hours. Prism is a new blockchain protocol which is designed to achieve a natural scaling of Bitcoin's performance while maintaining its full security guarantees. We present an implementation of Prism which achieves a throughput of seventy thousand transactions per second and confirmation latencies of tens of seconds

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract. 
# To change seventy thousand to 70,000
summary: Full-stack implementation of Prism in Rust acheives '70,000' transactions per second with '40' second latency.
